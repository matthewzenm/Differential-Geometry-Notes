# Differential-Geometry-Notes
A combined notes of differentiable manifolds and Riemannian geometry.

The writing plan (update to 2024/9/14) is:

Part 1. Smooth Manifolds
1. Smooth Manifolds
  - Category of Smooth Manifolds: definition of smooth manifolds and smooth maps, partition of unity.
  - Submanifolds
  - Manifolds with Boundary
  - Tangent Space and Differential
  - Immersion and Embedding
  - Tangent Bundle
2. Vector Bundles
  - Definition: standard definition.
  - Construction of Vector Bundles: construct vector bundles via transition maps.
  - Sections: sections, in particular vector fields.
  - Algebraic Operation of Vector Bundles: direct sum, tensor product, quotient and dual.

  - Gauss-Codazzi Equations
  - Minimal Surfaces: first variation of area, mean curvature tensor, minimal graph.
4. Curvature and Topology I
  - Bonnet-Myers Theorem
  - Cartan-Hadamard Theorem
  - Space Forms
5. Comparison Theorems
  - Rauch and Hessian Comparison Theorems
  - Distance Function: cut locus, Hessian of distance function as second fundamental form.
  - Laplace Comparison Theorem: proof via Bochner formula, proof via geometric approach, in weak sense.
